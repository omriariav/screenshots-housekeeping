   # OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

## Usage

### Interactive Mode (Recommended)
```bash
python3 screenshot_renamer.py
```
This mode will:
- Show you how many screenshots were found
- Display estimated API costs before processing
- Ask for confirmation before proceeding
- Show real-time progress during processing
- Display final summary with actual costs and statistics

### Automatic Mode
```bash
python3 screenshot_renamer.py --auto
```
Processes all screenshots without user interaction (useful for automation). Shows cost estimates and final usage summary.

## Automation Setup

### Setting Up Automatic Screenshot Processing

To automatically process new screenshots as they're created, you can set up macOS Folder Actions using Automator. This will run the script whenever new screenshots appear on your Desktop.

#### Method 1: Automator + Folder Actions (Recommended)

**Step 1: Create the Automator Workflow**

1. **Open Automator** (Applications → Automator)
2. **Choose "Folder Action" template**
3. **Set folder** to "Desktop" (~/Desktop)
4. **Add "Run Shell Script" action** from the Library
5. **Set Shell to `/bin/bash`**
6. **Set "Pass input" to "as arguments"**
7. **Add this script**:
   ```bash
   #!/bin/bash
   # Navigate to project directory and run with virtual environment
   cd /Users/$(whoami)/Code/screenshots-housekeeing
   ./venv-screenshots/bin/python screenshot_renamer.py --auto
   ```
   
   **Note**: If you named your virtual environment differently, update the path accordingly:
   - For `venv`: `./venv/bin/python screenshot_renamer.py --auto`
   - For `env`: `./env/bin/python screenshot_renamer.py --auto`
   - For system Python: `python3 screenshot_renamer.py --auto`
8. **Save as "Screenshot Auto Renamer"**

**Step 2: Enable Folder Actions**

1. **Find Folder Actions Setup**:
   - Press `Cmd + Space` and search "Folder Actions Setup"
   - Or go to Applications → Utilities → Script Editor → File → Open → Navigate to saved workflow

2. **Enable the Action**:
   - Check "Enable Folder Actions" at the top
   - Your Desktop folder should appear with "Screenshot Auto Renamer" attached
   - Ensure the checkbox next to your workflow is ✅ checked

**Step 3: Verify Setup**

1. **Check Folder Actions Setup**:
   ```bash
   # Open Folder Actions Setup to verify
   open -a "Folder Actions Setup"
   ```
   You should see:
   - ✅ "Enable Folder Actions" checked
   - Desktop folder listed
   - "Screenshot Auto Renamer" workflow attached and enabled

2. **Test the Automation**:
   - Take a screenshot (`Cmd + Shift + 4` or `Cmd + Shift + 3`)
   - Wait 1-3 seconds for processing
   - Check if the screenshot was renamed with an AI description

**Step 4: Monitor and Debug**

1. **Check Processing Logs**:
   ```bash
   # View the latest log file
   tail -f ~/Desktop/screenshot_rename_log.txt
   ```

2. **Common Issues & Solutions**:
   - **Nothing happens**: Check if Folder Actions are enabled in Folder Actions Setup
   - **"Python not found"**: Update the script path to use absolute paths
   - **"Module not found"**: Ensure the `cd` command points to your project directory
   - **Permissions error**: Check that Automator has folder access permissions

#### Method 2: LaunchAgent (Advanced)

For more control, you can create a LaunchAgent that monitors the Desktop folder:

1. **Create the plist file**:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p ~/Library/LaunchAgents
   
   cat > ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.screenshots.renamer.plist << 'EOF'
   <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
   <!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
   <plist version="1.0">
   <dict>
       <key>Label</key>
       <string>com.screenshots.renamer</string>
       
       <key>ProgramArguments</key>
       <array>
           <string>/Users/$(whoami)/Code/screenshots-housekeeping/venv-screenshots/bin/python</string>
           <string>/Users/$(whoami)/Code/screenshots-housekeeping/screenshot_renamer.py</string>
           <string>--auto</string>
       </array>
       
       <key>WatchPaths</key>
       <array>
           <string>/Users/$(whoami)/Desktop</string>
       </array>
       
       <key>RunAtLoad</key>
       <true/>
       
       <key>ThrottleInterval</key>
       <integer>30</integer>
   </dict>
   </plist>
   EOF
   ```

2. **Load and start the agent**:
   ```bash
   launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.screenshots.renamer.plist
   launchctl start com.screenshots.renamer
   ```

3. **Verify it's running**:
   ```bash
   launchctl list | grep screenshots
   ```

**Note**: Update the Python path in the plist file if you used a different virtual environment name:
- Replace `venv-screenshots` with your actual virtual environment name
- For system Python, use `/usr/bin/python3` instead

## Configuration Options

Edit your `.env` file to customize behavior:

```bash
# API Configuration
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key_here
OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-4o  # or other vision-capable model

# Processing Settings
DESCRIPTION_LENGTH=5        # Target number of words in description
BATCH_SIZE=5               # Number of files to process per batch
